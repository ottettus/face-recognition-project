Face Recognition Project

Overview

This project is a simple real-time face recognition system that utilizes your webcam to capture video and detect faces. Built with Python, the application leverages popular libraries like OpenCV for video capture and the face_recognition library for detecting faces in frames. The project follows best practices including a well-structured codebase, virtual environment management, and version control using Git with feature branches and descriptive commit messages.

Features

Real-Time Video Capture: Uses the default webcam to capture video.
Face Detection: Implements face detection on each frame using the face_recognition library.
Visual Feedback: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Modular Design: Organized using object-oriented programming to ensure code maintainability and scalability.
Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
face_recognition
NumPy
